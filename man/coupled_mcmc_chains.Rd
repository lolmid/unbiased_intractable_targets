\usage{
coupled_mcmc_chains(single_kernel, coupled_kernel, rinit, ..., K = 1,
  max_iterations = Inf, preallocate = 10)
}
\description{
sample two MCMC chains, each following 'single_kernel' marginally,
and 'coupled_kernel' jointly, until min(max(tau, K), max_iterations), where tau
is the first time the two chains meet. Or more precisely, they meet with a delay of one, i.e. X_t = Y_{t-1}.
